## Project Overview

Duplexes are a growing and increasingly popular housing type in Nigeria, appealing to families seeking privacy and spaciousness. They have become a significant part of the Nigerian real estate market, with demand driven by urbanization and economic growth.

However, purchasing a duplex requires careful financial planning due to the high costs involved. This makes it essential to analyze pricing trends by property type, state, and bedroom count to better understand affordability and market positioning.

This project was created to:

- Explore the pricing dynamics of duplexes in Nigeria.

- Compare average prices across Nigerian states.

- Assess how bedroom count influences pricing

- Understand the distribution and share of property types.

## Dataset

The dataset contains duplex listings with the following features:

Property Type – (Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced)

State – Location of the property

Price (₦) – Listing price

Bedrooms – Number of bedrooms in each property

## Dashboard Features

The Excel dashboard includes:

KPI Cards – Highlighting average prices of the duplex types

Bar Chart – Average Number of Bedroom by Property Type

Column Chart – Average price by number of bedrooms

Donut Chart – Proportion of listings by property type

Map Chart – Average price by state

Slicers & Dropdowns – For filtering by state, property type, and bedrooms

## Key Insights

1.Detached Duplexes dominate price levels

- Detached Duplexes offer full possession of land and structure, more privacy, more luxury features (extra living rooms, larger compounds, better finishing), and often sit in premium neighborhoods. They are viewed as status symbols in the Nigerian property market.

2. Semi-Detached Duplexes are the most affordable

- Semi-detached duplexes share a common wall with another unit, reducing land use and construction costs. They provide a balance of affordability and comfort, making them the entry point for families aspiring to own a duplex.

3. Terrace Duplexes are mid-range

- Terrace duplexes (row houses) are often built in clusters with shared facilities. While offering less privacy than detached, they provide urban convenience and are usually located in growing estates targeting middle-income buyers.

4. More bedrooms = higher price (as expected).

- Bedrooms directly correlate with size, land footprint, and finishing quality. However, outliers exist — some low-bedroom duplexes are overpriced due to location premiums (e.g., Lekki Phase 1, Asokoro, Maitama) rather than property size.

5. State-level variation

Premium States: FCT and Lagos top the charts 

- These cities are economic and political hubs, driving demand and inflating prices. Land is scarce, and luxury properties cater to both locals and expatriates.

Affordable States: Northern and Eastern states show lower averages. Land is cheaper, demand is lower, and urbanization is less aggressive.

6. Detached Duplexes dominate the higher-bedroom category, while Semi-Detached and Terrace Duplexes cluster around mid-to-low bedroom counts.
